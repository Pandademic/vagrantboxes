Additional list of places where you can get all sorts of vagrant base boxes for different purposes: development, testing, or even production.

- [**vagrantbox.es**](http://vagrantbox.es)

 A List of vagrant base boxes. Initiated by Gareth Rushgrove `@garethr` hosted on Heroku using Nginx. See the story here: [**The Vagrantbox.es Story**](http://www.morethanseven.net/2012/07/01/The-vagrantbox.es-story/).

- **Opscode** [**bento**](https://github.com/opscode/bento)

 We all know what **bento** means in Japanese, right? In this case, they are **NOT** lunch boxes **BUT** handy base boxes which can be used to test cookbooks or anything you want. Distributions included: Ubuntu Server, Debian, CentOS and Fedora.

- [**Vagrant Ubuntu Cloud Images**](http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/vagrant/)

 It's been there since Jan, 2013. For some reason Canonical has NOT officially promoted it yet, may be still in beta. Remember these are vanilla images ONLY.

If you are looking for Virtual Machines with server applications (e.g. GitLab, Discourse, WordPress, Redmine, Ruby Stack, Joomla!, Drupal etcâ€¦) pre-installed and configured, try Bitnami Stacks.
